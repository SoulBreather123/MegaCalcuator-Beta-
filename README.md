# MegaCalcuator-Beta-
MegaCalcuator Beta 1.2
This is beta version of MegaCalcuator. This is my first python project!
But dont see MegaCalcuator as a simple calcuator. After few weeks or months it will be very responsive program.
I will update MegaCalcuator slowly. If i be very fast, i will have many problems.

Usage:

1.First copy link of page.

2.Then write:
git clone {link of page}   Note: i think "git clone" doesnt works in powershell. But it works in CMD or Git Bash %100

3.Then go to file or folder and run it!!

Enjoy!!!
